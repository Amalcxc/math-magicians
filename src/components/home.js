    We coded and developed each calculator individually and put each one through strict,
    comprehensive testing. However, please inform us if you notice even the slightest
    error â€“ your input is extremely valuable to us. While most calculators on Calculator.
    net are designed to be universally applicable for worldwide usage, some are for
    specific countries only.
    For example, the Income Tax Calculator is for United States residents only.
